        <p>Cheetarah and Throckmorton went to a Vipassana retreat in Big Sur. They figured a silent retreat would be good since they can’t really talk anyway, and when they do try to make sounds to communicate it tends to make people go into fight, flight or freeze mode. Turns out the other practitioners kind of kept their distance, so they made the best of things and just worked on their trust and intimacy by doing an acro-yoga workshop together. They really enjoyed it and told each other they would find a class when they got home. Overhearing this conversation, their instructor buttered them up and told them they should get their acro-yoga teacher certification, and wouldn’t you know, she happens to have 2 openings just for them. $2000 a pop, which is only half the normal price, a special she gives her retreat students. They are a bit naive to the ways of humans, so I just smiled and stayed positive when they told me about it. I tried not to sound patronizing when responding “That’s wonderful, I’m not surprised she thought you were naturals. I mean you have those amazing feline spines that allow you to contort and pounce...Oh, Throckmorton, of course she thinks you’re an intuitive base…you’re both sure you don’t want to take a second class first?…no I’m not saying you shouldn’t make a commitment to your practice, please don’t put words in my mouth Cheetarah…“.  They asked me to come with them next year when I’m on a software engineers salary and also want me to ask all of you to join their first workshop at Burning Man, and to please let you know they’ll give all Cohort 18 Addies a 50% discount if we sign up before February. It felt really uncomfortable and awkward to say the least. Plus they were getting high on catnip (the instructors boyfriend “gifted” them) so I could barely get a word in. How do you tell a Snow Leopard and a Tiger they just stepped into one of America’s most socially acceptable pyramid schemes, and no, I’m not going to join? Don’t get me wrong, I think it’s great they are putting themselves out there as two apex predators trying to build community with prey animals. I mean the mountain of self-will it must take for them to not devour the other yogis, especially those hanging upside down with their hair fluttering in the wind like string. That’s not something to scoff at. Anyway, I changed the subject at the first possible opportunity. Here’s their initial go at a social media flyer for their “practice”</p>
