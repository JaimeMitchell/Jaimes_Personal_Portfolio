    <article>
        <p>I'm a remote junior software engineer based in New York City.
            Formerly a multimedia artist with over 20 years of professional experience in digital arts and content
            creation, including industrial design (toy design), illustration, photography, video production.
            These skills have transferred over into software development.
            I bring creative problem solving and a strong set of eagle-eyes towards debugging. Diligent in my creations,
            very detail-oriented while keeping a firm grasp of the big picture.</p>

        <p>I have experience building full-stack apps with Python, Flask,
            JavaScript, React, as well as building websites and games using vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS.</p>

        <!-- <p>An Asset to any team. Easy to talk, empathic, a good listener, quick to help if asked. I have experience
            playing on teams in both athletics and
            in the work arena and take community cooperation very seriously.
            A good public speaker and story-teller. I am active and vocal for my queer community, my disability
            community and for womenâ€™s rights.</p>
        <br> -->
        <p>Added bonus: Sparkling personality, decent sense of humor, easy to talk to, very DIY. I built my tiny home on
            wheels, which I currently live and work in.</p>
