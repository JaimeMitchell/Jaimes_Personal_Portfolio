        <section class="main"><h2>About Cheetarah</h2><p>Cheetarah was orphaned as a kitten and raised by river dolphins. Her practice of deep breathing (which enables one to hold their breath for long periods of time) began out of a cub’s necessity to survive in the deeps of the Ganges River. Cheetarah took to freestyle diving like a dolphin takes to Olympic speed-walking in an Akron mall, but with persistence and her chosen fam’s patience, Cheetarah grew to be the snow leopard they are today. Cheetarah spends half the year skiing in Canada and the other half in the Ganges. They are a proud co-parent of Dolly, a river dolphin calf, named after Cheetarah’s primary partner’s lover’s siblings’s ternary partner’s grandmother’s favorite singer-songwriter.</p></section>
