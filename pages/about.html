    <article>
        <p>
            I'm a remote junior software engineer based in New York City. Formerly a multimedia artist with over 20
            years of professional experience in digital arts and content creation, including industrial design (toy
            design), illustration, photography, video production. These skills have transferred over into software development. I bring creative problem solving and a strong
            set of eagle-eyes towards debugging. Diligent in my creations, very detail-oriented while keeping a firm
            grasp of the big picture.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have experience building full-stack apps with Python, Flask, JavaScript, React, as well as building
            websites and games using vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS.
        </p>

        <p>
            Added bonus: Sparkling personality, decent sense of humor, easy to talk to, very DIY. I built my tiny home
            on wheels, which I currently live and work in.
